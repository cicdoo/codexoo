**An in-Odoo AI assistant powered by the OpenAI Codex CLI. It answers questions,
queries your data, and builds reports — running as the logged-in user, never as
superuser, with a full audit trail.**

## Why Codexoo?

Most "AI for Odoo" add-ons either ship your data to a third-party prompt or hand
the model a superuser connection and hope for the best. **Codexoo is built the
other way around — security first:**

| | Codexoo |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Runs as the user** | Every ORM action executes with `su=False`, so the user's `ir.model.access` rights and record rules are enforced automatically. The model can never see or do more than the person using it. |
| 🧮 **Read-only SQL, really** | `sql_select` is double-guarded: a SELECT-only text validator (no stacked statements, row locks, or dangerous functions) **and** Postgres `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` + a statement timeout. Gated to a dedicated *AI SQL Analyst* group. |
| 🧾 **Full audit log** | Every tool call — model, method, SQL, row counts, outcome, even denials — is written to an immutable log on a separate committed cursor, so it survives rollbacks. |
| 🔑 **Per-user login, no shared key** | Each user clicks **Login with ChatGPT** and authorizes with their own subscription via the Codex device-code flow. Credentials are stored per user in a private `CODEX_HOME`, mode `0600`, never in the database, never echoed back. |
| 🚫 **Sandboxed engine, no surprises** | Codex runs in a **read-only sandbox with approvals disabled**, so the model cannot touch the shell, filesystem, or network on its own. The authoritative boundary is server-side: the model can affect Odoo **only** through a small set of tools over a loopback bridge that holds *no database credentials*. |
| ⚡ **Streaming UX** | Replies and tool "chips" stream into the chat in real time over the Odoo bus. |

If you sell or run Odoo for clients, the security posture **is** the feature: you
can give business users a natural-language window into their ERP without widening
anyone's access by a single record.

## 🏗 How it works

```
OWL chat UI ──/codexoo/send (auth=user)──► Odoo worker ──► daemon thread
   ▲ bus stream (deltas, tool chips)                          │ spawns
   │                          codex exec --json (ChatGPT login, read-only sandbox)
   │                          tool surface = mcp__odoo__* ONLY
   │                                       │ stdio MCP
   │                                       ▼
   │               bridge/mcp_server.py  (no DB creds, loopback only)
   │                                       │ Bearer(session token)
   └──── bus.bus ◄── controllers/tools.py (auth='codexoo_bridge', runs AS the user) ──► Postgres
```

- **Only Odoo touches the database.** The CLI subprocess and the MCP forwarder
  hold no credentials — only a short-lived, session-scoped HMAC bearer token.
- The bridge is reachable on **loopback only**; the `codexoo_bridge` auth method
  rejects any non-local caller and rebinds the request to the session's user
  (`su=False`).
- Codex itself is launched in a **read-only sandbox with approvals disabled**, so
  it cannot escape to the host; its only path to your data is the
  `mcp__odoo__*` tool surface.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements

- **Odoo 18.0**
- The **[OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** installed on the Odoo
  server (set its path via the `codexoo.cli_path` / `codexoo.cli_glob` system
  parameter; auto-detected if blank).
- A **ChatGPT subscription** per user (device-code login) — no API key required.

### Install

```bash
# Put the module on your addons_path (the repo is the module folder),
# then install it:
odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -d <your-db> -i codexoo --stop-after-init
# Restart your live server afterwards (Odoo does not re-import changed Python).
```

### First run

1. Open the **Codexoo** app from the top menu.
2. Click **Login with ChatGPT** and complete the device-code login in your browser.
3. Ask away: *"How many sale orders are still in draft this month?"*

Grant the **AI SQL Analyst** group to users who should be able to run read-only
SQL reports, and **AI Assistant Manager** to those who configure it and read the
audit log.

## 🔐 Security model

Codexoo treats LLM output as **untrusted** and defends accordingly:

- **Never superuser.** Tool endpoints abort if `request.env.su` is true.
- **ACLs + record rules** apply to every read and write, because the call runs as
  the user.
- **Writes are opt-in.** Read tools are the default; each write tool
  (`orm_create/write/unlink`, `orm_action`, `run_wizard`, `run_server_action`)
  must be granted per user, and **zero-trust mode** strips them entirely.
- **SQL can only read.** See the guard above.
- **Read-only sandbox.** Codex runs with approvals disabled and no host write/network
  access; the server-side bridge + per-user ACLs are the authoritative boundary.
- **Capability tokens** expire, are session-scoped, single-jti, and HMAC-signed
  with the database secret.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model and how to report a
vulnerability.

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Settings → Codexoo** (or System Parameters `codexoo.*`):

| Parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cli_path` / `cli_glob` | Path (or glob) to the Codex CLI binary (auto-detected if blank) |
| `model` | Codex model id (blank = your account's default model) |
| `max_turns`, `timeout_s` | Per-turn limits |
| `home_root`, `scratch_root` | Per-user `CODEX_HOME` and CLI scratch directories |
| `base_url` | Loopback URL the bridge calls back on |
| `sql_enabled` | Master switch for `sql_select` |
| `zero_trust_default` | Global default for read-only (zero-trust) mode |
| `python_bin` | Interpreter used to run the bundled bridge scripts (defaults to Odoo's) |

### Permissions / groups

- **AI Assistant User** — can use the chat (ORM reads).
- **AI SQL Analyst** — additionally may run `sql_select`.
- **AI Assistant Manager** — configuration + audit log; sees all sessions.

---

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -d <db> -i codexoo --test-enable --test-tags codexoo --stop-after-init
```

Covers the SQL guard, bridge-token mint/verify, the tool-access policy, the
`codexoo_bridge` auth method, and the audit log. CI runs them on every push and PR.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- Approval-gated `orm_create`/`orm_write`/`orm_unlink` with before→after diff cards
- An admin allow/deny **policy model** for tools and models
- A dedicated `ai_sql_ro` Postgres role + view scoping
- Tighter OS-level sandboxing of the CLI subprocess
- Per-session rate and tool budgets
